      Ascacou is a two player game, created by my uncle Marc Buonomo.
      Iâ€™ve made an online and an electron version of this game, which you
      can find on <a href="https://github.com/BuonOmo/ascacou">github</a>.
      Soon it will be an online game, using Ruby on Rails or Nodejs.

      Yesterday I was wondering about which one to choose between Ruby on Rails
      or Express framework. Ruby is way prettier and thus more attractive.
      However, is it as efficient as javascript which is made to work
      asynchronously?
